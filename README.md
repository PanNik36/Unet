# Deep Learning Tutorial for Kaggle Ultrasound Nerve Segmentation competition, using Keras

This tutorial shows how to use [Keras library](http://keras.io/) to build deep neural network for ultrasound image nerve segmentation.
More info on this Kaggle competition can be found on [https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation).

This deep neural network achieves **~0.57 score on the leaderboard** based on test images,
and can be a good staring point for further, more serious approaches.

The architecture was inspired by [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/).
